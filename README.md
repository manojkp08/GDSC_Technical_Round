# GDSC_Technical_Round

In this project I have created a login screen using Kotlin, XML, and Firebase Authentication. 
Firebase Authentication is a convenient way to handle user authentication in your Android app.

## Prerequisites

Android Studio: Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) if you haven't already.

  - Connect your project to Firebase by following the Firebase setup instructions.
 
- Make sure to add your Firebase configuration file (google-services.json) to the app directory.
- Set up the XML layout:
  - Customize the XML layout (res/layout/activity_login.xml) for your login screen.
- Implement the Login Logic:
  - Open the Kotlin file (LoginActivity.kt) and implement the logic for handling user authentication.
- Run the App:
  - Build and run the app on an Android emulator or physical device to test the login screen.
 
## Usage

- The login screen will allow users to sign in using their email and password.

## Acknowledgments

- Thanks to Firebase for providing a powerful authentication solution for Android apps.
